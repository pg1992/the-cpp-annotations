The C++ Annotations :godmode:
=============================

I created this repo to save some programming exercises and notes taken from the
great book `C++ Annotations Version 12.2.0
<https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/cppannotations/cppannotations/html/index.html>`_
written by Frank B. Brokken from the University of Groningen.
